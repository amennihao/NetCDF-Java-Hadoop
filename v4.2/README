ncSrc-4.2.tar.gz is the source code and netcdfAll-4.2.jar is the binary library.

You can build the binary by yourself with executing "ant makeMainComplete" in cdm diretory of the source code.

The API for the NetCDF file operations remain basically the same with the official library. You just use the hadoop's path like "hdfs://master:54310/user/yifeng/test.nc" instead of the local path.

For more information about the API usage, please refer to http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf-java/.
