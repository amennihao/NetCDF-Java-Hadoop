ncSrc-4.2.tar.gz is the source code and netcdfAll-4.2.jar is the binary library which is built with hadoop-core-0.20.203.0.jar

You can build the binary by yourself by executing "ant makeMainComplete" in cdm diretory with the hadoop core library in the lib/external.

The API for the NetCDF file operations remain basically the same with the official library. You just use the hadoop's path like "hdfs://master:54310/user/yifeng/test.nc" instead of the local path.

For more information about the API usage, please refer to http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf-java/.
